angular route

redirect to property allows for a hardcoded route or a function

Could be used to redirect to login or if user doesn't have permissions to view route etc.
            .when('/classrooms/:id', {
                controller: 'AllClassroomsController',
                controllerAs: 'classrooms',
                templateUrl: '/app/templates/allClassrooms.html',
                redirectTo: function (params, currPath, currSearch) {
                    console.log(params);
                    console.log(currPath);
                    console.log(currSearch);
                    return '/';
                }
            })

caseInsensitiveMatch: true

makes routes not case sensitive

Can add events to the route service which will be for all route changes.

    app.run(['$routeScope', '$log', function ($rootScope, $log) {

        $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeSuccess', function (event, current, previous) {
            $log.debug('successfully changed routes');

            $log.debug(event);
            $log.debug(current);
            $log.debug(previous);

        });
    }])


# 6/14/2016  UI-Router

uses states instead of url but can also use url

ui-sref instead of href=

get more url matchings items with ui router can match regular expressions

nested states inherit controllers and params from the parent state

parent state ui must have a ui-view directive in it
